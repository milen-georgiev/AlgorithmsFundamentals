# Molecules
* You are part of science team which is on an exploration mission in newly discovered planet inhabiting the goldilock zone of a distant star (insert random digits as name here).
  You have found a peace of tissue which consist of different molecules connected in order.
  The biology team want from you do develop a program which by given molecule as a source determines to which other molecules there is no way to transport energy. On the way to any other molecule you may have to pass through other molecules etc.
  Print on a new line separated by spaces print the numbers of molecules you cannot transport energy to from the start molecule. Print them in increasing order.
  Input
* The input will come from the console:
  * On the first line the number of molecules N
  * On the second line the number of connections between the molecules M
  * On each M line the data describing the connections:
  {fromMolecule} {toMolecule}
  * On the next line single integer the start molecule number
* Output
  * On the single output line print the molecules in increasing order to which there is no connection from start molecule.
* Constraints
  * All input lines will be valid integers you do not need to check that.
  * The range of the integers will be in the range [1â€¦1000]
  * The molecules number will be numbers from one increasing for each molecule.
